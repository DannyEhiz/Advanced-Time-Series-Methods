<h1><b><i>Project Readme: XGBoost Time Series Prediction with Lag Features</i></b></h1>

This project aims to develop a time series prediction model using the XGBoost algorithm. The prediction model incorporates lag features, which capture the relationship between past observations and future outcomes. Additionally, the model utilizes date-related features such as month, day, week, and year to enhance the prediction accuracy.

## Project Overview
The main objective of this project is to forecast future values of a time series based on historical data. The XGBoost algorithm is chosen for its ability to handle complex relationships and effectively capture temporal patterns in time series data.

The project follows these key steps:

1. Data Preprocessing: The initial step involves cleaning and preparing the time series data. This may include handling missing values, data normalization, and feature engineering.

2. Feature Engineering: Lag features are created by incorporating past observations as predictors for future values. Additionally, date-related features such as month, day, week, and year are extracted and included in the feature set.

3. Time Series Split: To evaluate the model's performance and assess its generalization ability, the data is split into train and test sets using the TimeSeriesSplit function from the scikit-learn library. This split ensures that the model is trained on past data and evaluated on future data.

4. Cross-Validation Training: The model is trained using cross-validation, which helps assess its stability and robustness. Cross-validation involves splitting the training set into multiple subsets and training the model on different combinations of these subsets. This process aids in obtaining a more accurate estimate of the model's performance.

5. Model Training and Evaluation: The XGBoost algorithm is employed to train the time series prediction model. The model is tuned using hyperparameter optimization techniques to improve its performance. The trained model is then evaluated using appropriate evaluation metrics, such as mean squared error (MSE), mean absolute error (MAE), or R-squared (R2) score.

6. Prediction and Visualization: Finally, the trained model is used to make predictions on the test set. The predicted values are compared with the actual values, and the results are visualized using plots and charts to provide insights into the model's accuracy and performance.
