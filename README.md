<h1><b><i>Advanced-Time-Series-Methods</i></b></h1>

This repository contains implementations of two popular time series forecasting methods: XGBoost Time Series and LSTM Time Series. These methods utilize different approaches to model and predict future values in time series data.

## XGBoost Time Series

The XGBoost Time Series method utilizes the XGBoost algorithm, which is an optimized gradient boosting framework. It leverages lag features, capturing the relationship between past observations and future outcomes, to make accurate predictions. The model also incorporates date features such as month, day, week, and year to further enhance prediction accuracy.

## LSTM Time Series

The LSTM Time Series method employs Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks. LSTM networks are well-suited for modeling sequential data, such as time series, as they can effectively capture temporal dependencies. This method utilizes the sequential nature of the data to learn patterns and make accurate predictions.

## Usage

1. Clone or download the repository to your local machine.

2. Install the required dependencies, including Python (version 3.x), pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, xgboost, and tensorflow (for LSTM).

3. Prepare your time series data in a suitable format, ensuring it contains the necessary features and the target variable to be predicted.

4. Explore the respective folders for XGBoost Time Series and LSTM Time Series methods. Modify the code to incorporate your specific data and requirements.

5. Run the code, following the instructions and guidelines provided in each method's folder, to train the models and make predictions on your time series data.

6. Evaluate the performance of each method using appropriate evaluation metrics and analyze the results to gain insights into the accuracy and effectiveness of the models.

## Note

Each method folder contains its own specific implementation details, including data preprocessing, model training, hyperparameter tuning, and evaluation. Follow the instructions within each folder to utilize the corresponding method effectively.
